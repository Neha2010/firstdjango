# firstdjango

This is a very basic django project which i did as a part of learning . It is missing so many things . It was basically made to understand the Model View Template 
architecture of django.
It has the following --

1.A home page having two button links for 'Login' & 'Register'
2.After Logging in , the user details that have been taking while registration would be returned.
3.In the login & registration forms , it has JS validations for mobile no , email etc.
4.Templates have also been used.
5.There is no CSS used as such.
